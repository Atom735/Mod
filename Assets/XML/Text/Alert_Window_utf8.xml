Strings for the alert window

Note that the rules are different here than in other text xml files.
This is because the alert window will read this file directly rather than relying on the normal TXT_KEY system,
as the alert window needs to be active prior to the TXT_KEYs are being read.

Special rules:
No plural or gender. Just provide one string for each language.
Arguments are given using the printf system https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/
In general, this means arguments are named %d (number) and %s (string). No numbers given as that is assigned by order.
